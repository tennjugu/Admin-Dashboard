# Admin-Dashboard
## Description

This is an admin dashboard project built as part of The Odin Project's curriculum, with a primary focus on refining skills in utilizing CSS Grid. The dashboard is created using HTML and CSS, without relying on data from an API. The project aims to enhance your understanding of CSS Grid layout and its application in creating responsive and visually appealing web designs.

The dashboard simulates a user's admin account, providing various features to manage projects, stay updated with announcements, and engage with trending posts within the community. Users can also interact with the dashboard, such as uploading new posts and sharing their profile links.
